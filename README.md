# Plant Disease Prediction

A web-based application for detecting plant leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the PlantVillage dataset. Built with Python, TensorFlow, and Streamlit, it allows users to upload leaf images and receive real-time disease predictions with treatment recommendations. Achieves 92% accuracy across 38 disease classes for 14 crop species.

## Features
- Upload JPEG/PNG leaf images for disease detection.
- CNN model with 92% accuracy, trained on PlantVillage dataset.
- Streamlit-based web interface for real-time predictions and recommendations.
- Image preprocessing: resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
- Deployed on Streamlit Cloud for global accessibility.
